Assignment 2
In this assignment, you will develop a knowledge base using ontological concepts.

This is a group project.

1. create a group of 4 people

2. Select a topic for your ontology from the choice option given in the course general section

3. Read the Ontology Development 101 by Stanford university - https://protege.stanford.edu/publications/ontology_development/ontology101.pdf

4. Follow the steps in section 3 in the guide and design your ontology.

Note that an ontology is an open-ended design. Two ontologies designed for the same domain may differ. Also the domain can be too large to cover by a simple ontology. If this is the case for the ontology you selected,  clearly define the scope(i.e. what you will consider and what you will omit).

5. Build the ontology in protege (https://protege.stanford.edu/) and extract the final file.



Deliverables

1. The protege file - submit to this assignment

2. A report. This report should first describe give a general description to your domain and the scope. Then you should comprehensively discuss the steps you followed in developing the ontology. I.e. the set of steps given in the Stanford ontology guide. You need to answer the questions listed in the guide (e.g. What is the domain that the ontology will cover?). Note that for many domains, ontologies have already been developed, You can refer to related ontologies. But if you reused any existing ontology, in the report clearly indicate which ontology it is, and how and most importantly WHY you changed that ontology to create yours.

This report should be submitted to the Turnitin assignment link.
